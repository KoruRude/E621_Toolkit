Unified E621 Toolkit - 21Mar2025

Designed to be ran on Linux based systems or systems that can run Bash and python scripts.
Other dependencies are wget and python3

A few tools to mess with e621.net's API for fun! (While following all of their rules/requirements to the best of my knowledge)
Kinda a download and run type of idea, idk lol

Each directory has its own readme so make sure to view them for more info
